    // You may need to find alternative libraries for numpy, pandas, and snps in PHP, as these libraries are specific to Python
    // For numpy, consider using a library such as MathPHP: https://github.com/markrogoyski/math-php
    // For pandas, you can use DataFrame from https://github.com/aberenyi/php-dataframe, though it is not as feature-rich as pandas
    // For snps, you'll need to find a suitable PHP alternative or adapt the Python code to PHP

    // import copy // In PHP, you don't need to import the 'copy' module, as objects are automatically copied when assigned to variables

    // from itertools import groupby, count // PHP has built-in support for array functions that can handle these operations natively

    // import logging // For logging in PHP, you can use Monolog: https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog
    use Monolog\Logger;
    use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

    // import os, re, warnings
    // PHP has built-in support for file operations, regex, and error handling, so no need to import these modules

    // import numpy as np // See the note above about using MathPHP or another PHP library for numerical operations
    // import pandas as pd // See the note above about using php-dataframe or another PHP library for data manipulation

    // from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype // If using php-dataframe, check documentation for similar functionality

    // For snps.ensembl, snps.resources, snps.io, and snps.utils, you'll need to find suitable PHP alternatives or adapt the Python code
    // from snps.ensembl import EnsemblRestClient
    // from snps.resources import Resources
    // from snps.io import Reader, Writer, get_empty_snps_dataframe
    // from snps.utils import Parallelizer

    // Set up logging
    $logger = new Logger('my_logger');
    $logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('php://stderr', Logger::DEBUG));
